# OS_Codes

This repository contains codes relating to the working of concepts of OS which were never actually implemented as part of our OS course. These are for learning and having a better understanding of working of Operating Systems (focusing on linux based systems) by gaining hands on experience.
I would recommend running these codes on virtual box , especially LKM (Linux Kernal Modules) as the errors in the modules might result in crashing of the whole system.
